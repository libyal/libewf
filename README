Dependencies
Libewf requires:
* zlib

ewftools require:
* libcrypto (OpenSSL)
  or Windows Crypto API from the Windows Platform SDK
* libuuid (optional)


Creating a DLL
Multiple methods of creating a DLL are supported:
* using Borland C++
* using CodeGear
* using Cygwin
* using Microsoft Visual Studio C++
* using MingW


Creating a DLL using Borland C++
TODO


Creating a DLL using Cygwin
You'll need Cygwin with:
* binutils
* gcc-core
* bison (for libodraw)
* flex (for libodraw)
* autoconf
* automake
* make
* libtool
* gettext
* zlib-devel
* openssl-devel (for ewftools)
* libuuid-devel (optional)

Building the library:
./configure
make libewf

You should end up with the following DLL:
libewf-<version>/libewf/.libs/cygewf-0.dll


Creating a DLL using CodeGear
TODO


Creating a DLL using Microsoft Visual Studio C++
You'll need:
* Microsoft Visual Studio C++
  The provided Visual Studio project files were created using
  the 2008 express version. The express verion is available on the
  Microsoft website
* Microsoft Windows SDK (if not already included) for the Windows Crypto API
  The Windows SDK is available on the Microsoft website
* The zlib 1.2.5 source package including from the zlib project site:
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

Extract the contents of the zlib DLL package to:
libewf-<version>/msvscpp/zlib-1.2.5

Make sure to check if your build environment defines the correct WINVER for your build.
The code uses WINAPI version specific functions based on WINVER.
You can define a custom WINVER in the msvscpp project files or in libewf-<version>/common/config_msc.h

You should be able to build the libewf DLL using the provided
project files. Note that the project files contain a Release and VSDebug configuration.


Creating a DLL using MingW
See documents/mingw.txt


Using a DLL
Make sure you use define LIBEWF_DLL_IMPORT before including <libewf.h>,
i.e. CFLAGS=-DLIBEWF_DLL_IMPORT

When the libewf DLL was build with Microsoft Visual Studio
you'll need the zlib DLL. To run the executables on other platforms
than the build platform, you'll need the Microsoft Visual Studio redistributable DLLs.
If you want to create your own Microsoft Visual Studio project files note that libewf needs
to be compiled with the paramete /MD, because stderr is passed from the executables.


Mac OS X
* missing libtoolize
* building multiple architure binaries


Missing libtoolize
Use glibtoolize instead


Building multiple architecture binaries
E.g. on Mac OS X 10.4 run the following commands:
CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386" LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386" ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --prefix=$PWD/macosx/tmp/
make
make install

The binaries are installed in $PWD/macosx/tmp/


Cygwin
* libuuid support

libuuid support
Install the e2fsprogs package and run the following commands:
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/e2fsprogs ./configure
make
make install
