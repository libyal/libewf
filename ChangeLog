* improve output when encountering a read error
* improve open file io pool (set basename ?)

* what about header values parsing with preservation of timestamps?
  - change localtime to gmtime in libewf_date_time_values_copy_to_string ?
  - force set header value to require string formatted in the date format ?
* check TODO
* check into resume write error for 32-bit compile (different zlib sizes)
* check make distclean

Next stable release:
* full test
* disable ewfdebug

Roadmap:
* code clean up
* improve python bindings (partial)
* improve device handle (libsmdev)
* support missing segment files (chunks)
* libbfio API extensions (partial)
* low and high level API
  - to allow low level access to sections etc. (for recovery)
* lvf support
  - set initial file entry offset
  - add support for permissions
* internationalisation
  - Unicode support (added)
  - locale support (partial)
  - multi language string support (gettext)
    need WINAPI version of gettext without libiconv dependency
* thread aware lvf support
  - implement libewf_single_file_entry_clone
  - what about current offset and IO back-end ?
* enhance thread safety
  - protect writing to internal data structures
  - protect reading when writing to internal data structures
  - thread safe functions
  - check for race conditions especially on change of data elements
* library/tools enhancements
  - getoptlong
* ewfx enhancements
  - xsignature section to sign xhash and/or hash

Code clean up:
* clean up configure.ac
* implement libmfdata
* move sections into separate objects ?
* refactor section_list to list_type and section_value ?
* clean up ewfacquire: move imaging preferences into imaging handle
* make debug output similar to other libraries
  - clean up libewf_section.c

Further analysis of the EWF format:
* password hash
* volume/disk section (EWF-E01)
   - do EnCase 5 or earlier versions support 64-bit number of sectors?
   - unknowns
* hash section (EWF-E01)
  - 16 byte unknown
* values in EnCase5/6 header2 (+/-)
* values in ltree strings (EWF-L01 LVF)
* values in session section (+/-)
* number of sectors in volume/data section has changed to a 64-bit value
  but what about error2/sessions ?
* does newer linen6 has sha1 support?
* LVF: single file entry:
  - are flags similar to file attribute flags ?

Features
* resume write support for ENCASE1/SMART table sections ?
* support missing segment files (chunks)
* implement low memory usage option
  - trade off IO versus memory use

Recovery and analysis:
* imaging: detect disk full and ask for new segment file location?
  - have libewf allow to set the segment file path during write (done)
  - have separate function to preallocate segment file?
  - like alternative segment file path in EnCase
    however EnCase seems to fully test if the segment file upfront by
    allocating the necessary disk space
* recovering corrupt EWF files (missing segment file, corrupt sections, etc.)
  - can the values in data be used to correct a corrupted volume ?

Additional (integrity) checks:
* read: check if successive headers match first header
* read: add check for next and done segment
  - really the last segment in the file
  - offset pointing at themselves
  - correct size

Possible performance improvements:
* create a offset table per segment file
  - create it on demand
  - map offset table start entry from segment table as a pointer or index number ?
* fill offset table while reading ?
  - only read first and last segment file for index build?
  - add offsets of other segment files when needed
* tune read and write buffer sizes
  - read/write block size seems to have little effect for dd on average
  - buffered bfio ?
* reduce alloc, realloc and free (this reduces breaks) use strace to analyze
  - pass values as parameters or use of handle
  - what allocation causes the break in strace of ewfacquire with compression libewf? zlib?
* optimize empty block test
* optimize string functions
  - pass length/size as much as possible
* pass zero byte empty block compressed data cache as a pointer
  do not copy data to compressed chunk cache

Error handling/tollerance
* what about a function that translates error into an equivalent errno?
* have wchar error messages for WINAPI?
* improve offset table correction
  - if not correctable skip chunk while reading and mark as crc error
    or try to determine offset/size of chunk somehow

Python bindings (pyewf)
* add WINAPI wide character support for open() and glob()
* add more functions

API changes
* add wide character functions definitions by default?
  - not necessary on most platforms
* libbfio API extension
  - add means to obtain libbfio handle of media data in ewf
  - add means to set narrow string codepage
  - export libewf_glob_file_io_handle
    refactor glob functions to use libbfio handle input and return libbfio pool?
    think about libewf_glob_file_io_handle and abstration of file io handle get/set name
* low level API
  - add function to retrieve the segment file names and amount?
  - add function to retrieve EWFX xml header/hash directly
* LVF
  - libewf_add/remove_file for LVF
* file structure API extension (idea)

Tools:
* locale support
  - print output convert to system string
  - reduce string conversions, use as much as possible the system string type in the tools
* check char/wchar in/output
* rename wipe/clean buffer to zero buffer
* add getoptlong support
* make compilation resilient for missing crypto library
  - compile on system without libcrypto
  - remove the cryptographic options if crypto library is missing
* have failed on open return a more sensible error (extract from error)
* ewfacquire
  - restrict error granularity and amount per sectors to > encase5 and > linen5 format ?
    no, although not set in EWF file, the granualarity is still used in handling read errors
  - warn if values exceed maximum segment count
  - adjust error granularity if error granularity < process buffer size
    should not matter for libsmdev
  - warn if media does not fit using chunk size or APIv1
    a (32-bit) chunks size of ( 64 * 512 ) will allow up to 128 TiB
  - for EnCase 6 format request serial number and model if not set ?
  - add support to enter sessions for optical images
  - add support for unattended write resume ?
* ewfacquirestream
  - add parameter to set sector size?
  - allow user to set bytes per sector for raw file conversion
* stream handle
  - implement
* ewfexport
  - implement more ewfacquire acquiry parameters?
  - handle different input and ouput chunk sizes in low level functions build
  - allow different input and output header codepages?
  - handle ewf/raw like in smioexport
  - creates write only raw export file with msvscpp compilation
  - limit output formats for input types (lvf vs ewf)
  - does export handle require finalize of md5 and sha1 context?
  - add information and media values to raw output
* ewfdebug
  - create a tool to analyse a single segment file
  - implement low and high level api separation
* ewfrecover
  - create a tool recover ewf files

Windows build
* windows port
  - some of the CRT functions are MVC 2005 or later specific
  - figure out a way to warn about the compiler used
* add VC_EXTRALEAN to msvscpp config

Tests
* glob: .ezz, .faa ... .zzz
* seek: media size 0 instead of < 1024
* read: media size 0 instead of < 1024
* ewfexport: export of split RAW
* ewfexport: export of files

Deployment:

Known issues:
* error acquiring USB floppy with bad blocks under FreeBSD - no problem with internal floppy drive
  virtualisation could be part of the problem
* check chunk size for > 2 GiB table offsets
  the current assumption is that these chunks only can be uncompressed
  because the MSB is normally used to mark if the chunk is compressed
  This actually is a bug in EnCase 6.7.1 the behavior is gone in EnCase 6.8
* MS Visual Studio C++ does not allow pre compiler macro in macro definitions

Deprecated functions
* add BORLANDC deprecated function support, unable to find suitable macro
  #pragma deprecated( function )
  __declspec(deprecated)

* added defines to ewfcommon for different buffer size testing

20061201
* added optimalization definitions - for testing

  - (basically EWF-E01 based format)
  - allows for section xheader, which contains header information in XML and is stored in an compressed string 

20061130
* problem with media size calculation due to change
  - note: uint32_t * uint32_t = uint32_t and will not upscale to uint64_t
* ewf_string: better solution for size*16 in ewf_string_uncompress
  - the length starts out with a factor 2 and keeps increasing by a factor 2 until string can be decompressed
* moved process status and summary functions to ewfcommon
* added process summary to ewfexport
* read: will uncompress chunk directly to chunk sized buffers for non compressed chunks
* are both the segment table and section list file descriptor value needed - can this be a single value?
  - the file descriptor in the section list was used as safe guard only - removed
* Only use the chunk cache when the input buffer size does not suffice for reading or writing an entire chunk
  - the chunk cache actually reduces performance for sequential reads due to additional memcpy - completed
* ewfverify: show status indicator
* ewfverify: when done show time and Mb/s

20061129
* Media size is calculated when not set
* Added -Wextra compile flag for addition warning values

  - in libewf_read_chunk - added segment number to offset table and file offset to segment table
    for basic offset tracking
* found issues in documentation
  - EnCase1 (EWF-E01) format stores its chunks in the table sections not in the sectors section
    it uses an EWF-S01 alike layout
  - SMART in FTK Imager has a CRC at the end of the offset table
* fixed read and write regarding issues in documentation
* read: fixed error in recognizing FTK imager format

20061127
* worked on performance enhancements

* change char* to EWF_CHAR* or LIBEWF_CHAR*
  - allow for char and w_char interfacing with library
  - use LIBEWF_CHAR for char/w_char wrapping and EWF_CHAR for byte strings in EWF file format, CHAR_T required for wchar_t support in basic functions
  - make internal EWF related strings byte strings (EWF_CHAR) - make string functions safe to be char or uint8_t

20060821
* read: added basic support for L01 files, which are basically EWF files
* renamed ewf_file_signature to evf_file_signature - closer to the truth
* ewfacquire: compensate for maximum S01 file size in ewf file size question - determine maximum
  - not relevant because there is a maximum of chunks within the file but the
  other data could grow to the 2 GiB

20060820
* ewfacquire: small change to confirmation

20060819
* lifted the 255 segment file limit on write, however it uses an (horrible) increment based naming scheme much like EnCase

* alternative read method was removed, the assumption it was based on is no longer valid
  read: remove alternative read method the assumption behind is fails for the SMART format - completed
* renamed alternative write method to wipe block on read error
  write: rename the alternative write method to wipe_block_on_error (or something) - completed
* read random: chunk based size check now is a buffer based size check
* removed handle->chunk_crc no longer needed

20060516
* added media size to ewfinfo
* worked on ewfacquire read on error

20060513
* minor adjustment in libewf.h - ewf_close renamed to libewf_close

20060505
* Fix for older compilers like gcc 2.95 - rewrite to older C statements

20060424
* added warning macro to allow overriding some fatal errors
* allow overriding invalid CRC's
* refactored crc check in ewf_section to file_read - for scope of handle and uniformity within the code

20060423
* Fix for Solaris in definitions.h

20060422

20060419
* Adjusted write method - to fix filesize problem
* Correction of verbose print of last chunk number
* the write function works only when a data section is at the start of the file - why ? not a bug in write
  but in read the first offset in the segment table was filled with 0 instead of 13 which is the size
  of the file header

20060418
* Tested on FreeBSD 6.0 needed to add include header in ewf_sectors.h
* Adjusted Make to be more generic and to work on FreeBSD 6.0

20060415
* changed u_int to uint
* removed LIBEWF_ types
* zlib uses a long which varies per 32 and 64 bit architecture using an intermediate variable

* added time string generation code to header_values
* added acquire options for compression and file type to ewfacquire
* code now partially fixed for x86_64 systems fixed malloc statement, printf sizes, and some type definitions
* additional changes to memcpy statements made
* Use header_values for write
* ewfacquire fix error print on correct fixed value
* ewfacquire fix for empty input values
* ewfacquire fix strange image file rights

* fix write crc error in chunk on mac os x
* ewfacquire add EWF file size input possibility - check upper bound 2 GiB, lower bound 1440k
* fix write bug with small file size 1440k - for floppy image - this has to do if
  both the filesize and the ewf size are the same - write will adjust with one additional segment file

20060413
* Used LIBEWF_VERSION in executables
* Added file signature function to library for integration in The SleuthKit
* Added md5.h for allowing to do with different MD5 calculation code bases
  like the one integrated in the The SleuthKit

20060412
