  - add DFXML output tests
*ewfverify
  - add option sets for single/multi threaded, chunks

Error tolerance:
* add setting to be less strict
  - non matching data section (set identifier)
  - expand number of chunks

Roadmap:
* lvf support
  - add support for permissions
  - thread aware support (check)
* error tollerance
  - allow for missing segment file(s)
  - allow for missing section(s)
  - allow for missing chunk(s). Can the chunks be shifted to match up with the
  last segment file.
* bindings
  - Python (partial)
  - .Net (partial)
  - Java/JNI
* improve device handle (libsmdev)
  - audio track support - libsmdev
* libbfio API extensions (partial)
* low and high level API
  - to allow low level access to sections etc. (for recovery)
  - allow access to segment table
  - allow access to offset/chunk table
  - ewfdebug
* internationalisation/localization (i18n/l10n)
  - Unicode support (added)
  - locale support (partial)
  - multi language string support (gettext)
    need WINAPI version of gettext without libiconv dependency
* library/tools enhancements
  - getoptlong
* ewfx enhancements
  - xsignature section to sign xhash and/or hash

Code clean up:
* clean up configure.ac and acinclude.m4
  - refactor dfxml check
* ewfinfo
  - move DFXML code to separate code files, what about separate library ?
  - implement a statefull XML writer e.g. open/close_section, open/close_value
* check TODO in code, mainly regarding improvements

BFIO support:
* improve open file io pool (set basename ?)

Further analysis of the EWF format:
* password hash
* volume/disk section (EWF-E01)
   - do EnCase 5 or earlier versions support 64-bit number of sectors?
   - unknowns
* hash section (EWF-E01)
  - 16 byte unknown
* values in EnCase5/6 header2 (+/-)
* values in ltree strings (EWF-L01 LVF)
* values in session section (+/-)
* number of sectors in volume/data section has changed to a 64-bit value
  but what about error2/sessions ? (sessions can be 32-bit)
* does newer linen6 has sha1 support?
* LVF: single file entry:
  - are flags similar to file attribute flags ?
  - parse first entries differently ? for file hierarchy
* FTK Imager: support for "Use AD Encryption"
  - requires support for ADCRYPT file format

Features
* add bzip2 support and tests
* resume write support for ENCASE1/SMART table sections ?
* implement low memory usage option
  - trade off IO versus memory use
* disk full check
  - how to detect this condition (cross-platform) ?
  - solution (A) at creation time of the segment file:
    linux/unix posix_fallocate(), does not provide the desired result
    windows SetFileInformationByHandle()
  - solution (B) on write (backtrack last chunk)
    implemented close segment file on LIBERROR_OUTPUT_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_SPACE 
    although if linux write fails (write_count != write_size) before ENOSPC is set
    there is still room left on the device, but cannot be claimed by libewf
* what about header values parsing with preservation of timestamps?
  - change localtime to gmtime in libewf_date_time_values_copy_to_string ? (NO!)
  - force set header value to require string formatted in the date format ?

Recovery and analysis:
* imaging: detect disk full and ask for new segment file location?
  - have libewf allow to set the segment file path during write (done)
  - have separate function to preallocate segment file?
  - like alternative segment file path in EnCase
    however EnCase seems to fully test if the segment file upfront by
    allocating the necessary disk space
    how to detect the destination has no available space ?
* recovering corrupt EWF files (missing segment file, corrupt sections, etc.)
  - can the values in data be used to correct a corrupted volume ?
* check into resume write error for 32-bit compile (different zlib sizes)
* detect consistent number of chunks in table sections

Error handling/tollerance
* what about a function that translates error into an equivalent errno?
* have wchar error messages for WINAPI?
* improve offset table correction
  - if not correctable skip chunk while reading and mark as crc error
    or try to determine offset/size of chunk somehow
* handle corruption in both table and table2 sections
  - non-overlapping corruption
  - overlapping corruption
* handle missing sections
* handle missing segment files
* handle corrupt segment files
* write resume
  - add support for ENCASE1/SMART table section

Additional (integrity) checks:
* read: check if successive headers match first header
* read: add check for next and done segment
  - really the last segment in the file
  - offset pointing at themselves
  - correct size

Possible performance improvements:
* libewf_device_info_parse do this directly from the UTF16 stream ?
* libewf_case_data_parse do this directly from the UTF16 stream ?
* tune read and write buffer sizes
  - read/write block size seems to have little effect for dd on average
  - buffered bfio ?
* reduce alloc, realloc and free (this reduces breaks) use strace to analyze
  - pass values as parameters or use of handle
  - what allocation causes the break in strace of ewfacquire with compression libewf? zlib?
* optimize string functions
  - pass length/size as much as possible
* do not write section start on data update
  - performance improvement is insignificant
* read certain section data on demand ?

Python bindings (pyewf)
* add WINAPI wide character support for open() and glob()
* add more functions
  - sessions
  - acquiry errors
  - read errors

.Net bindings (ewf.net)
* handle 
  - add more functions
* file entry
  - add more functions
* mono support ?

API changes
* low level API
  - segment file access
  - section access
  - chunk table access
  - add function to retrieve EWFX xml header/hash directly
* chunk table access
  - rewrite read/write chunk functions, pass chunk index
* add wide character functions definitions by default?
  - not necessary on most platforms
* libbfio API extension
  - add means to obtain libbfio handle of media data in ewf
  - add means to set narrow string codepage
  - export libewf_glob_file_io_handle
    refactor glob functions to use libbfio handle input and return libbfio pool?
    think about libewf_glob_file_io_handle and abstration of file io handle get/set name
* LVF support
  - add LVF write support: libewf_add/remove_file
  - add support for single file entry with "no content"
* file structure API extension (idea)

* libsystem path implement GetVolumeInformation
* ewfacquire:
  - print status info without confirmation in unattended mode
  - restrict error granularity and amount per sectors to > encase5 and > linen5 format ?
    no, although not set in EWF file, the granualarity is still used in handling read errors
  - warn if values exceed maximum segment count
  - adjust error granularity if error granularity < process buffer size
    should not matter for libsmdev
  - warn if media does not fit using chunk size or APIv1
    a (32-bit) chunks size of ( 64 * 512 ) will allow up to 128 TiB
  - for EnCase 6 format request serial number and model if not set ?
  - add support to manually provide sessions for optical images ?

Deployment:
* spec file
  - make flex, yacc include flexible ?
* add BORLANDC deprecated function support, unable to find suitable macro
  #pragma deprecated( function )
  __declspec(deprecated)
* windows build
  - some of the CRT functions are MVC 2005 or later specific
  - figure out a way to warn about the compiler used
  - add VC_EXTRALEAN to msvscpp config
* integrating libewf.rc into mingw dll ?

Known issues:
* error acquiring USB floppy with bad blocks under FreeBSD - no problem with internal floppy drive
  virtualisation could be part of the problem
* check chunk size for > 2 GiB table offsets
  the current assumption is that these chunks only can be uncompressed
  because the MSB is normally used to mark if the chunk is compressed
  This actually is a bug in EnCase 6.7.1 the behavior is gone in EnCase 6.8
* MS Visual Studio C++ does not allow pre compiler macro in macro definitions
* Cygwin compilation missing __xpg_strerror_r - bug in recent Cygwin 1.7.8

Closed:
* libewf_single_files refactor to use UTF-16 split string
  - does not really matter still need to do conversion to runtime UTF-16
* write resume, allow resume from volume/disk section
  - why bother no media data has been written anyway
* EWF2 can handle more then UINT16_MAX segment files - add support for this?
  - having more than 65000 segment files is a bit overkill,
    also the naming schema does not support this without creating odd names
    for now not adding support for this, unless there is a good reason to do so

* added process summary to ewfexport
* read: will uncompress chunk directly to chunk sized buffers for non compressed chunks
* are both the segment table and section list file descriptor value needed - can this be a single value?
  - the file descriptor in the section list was used as safe guard only - removed
* Only use the chunk cache when the input buffer size does not suffice for reading or writing an entire chunk
  - the chunk cache actually reduces performance for sequential reads due to additional memcpy - completed

* fixed read and write regarding issues in documentation
* read: fixed error in recognizing FTK imager format

20061127
