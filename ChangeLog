Roadmap:
* support missing segment files (chunks)
* multiple platform device handle
* libbfio API extensions
* low and high level API
  - to allow low level access to sections etc. (for recovery)
* lvf support
  - add support for interaction with data in ltree section
  - use libpff like item approach?
* xsignature section to sign xhash and/or hash
* library/tools enhancements
  - getoptlong
* internationalisation
  - Unicode support (added)
  - locale support
  - multi language string support (gettext)
* enhance thread safety
  - protect writing to internal data structures
  - protect reading when writing to internal data structures
  - thread safe functions
  - check for race conditions especially on change of data elements

Further analysis of the EWF format:
* password hash
* volume/disk section (EWF-E01)
   - do EnCase 5 or earlier versions support 64-bit amount of sectors?
   - unknowns
* hash section (EWF-E01)
  - 16 byte unknown
* values in EnCase5/6 header2 (+/-)
* values in ltree strings (EWF-L01 LVF)
* values in session section (+/-)
* amount of sectors in volume/data section has changed to a 64-bit value
  but what about error2/sessions ?
* does newer linen6 has sha1 support?

Features
* resume write support for ENCASE1/SMART table sections ?
* support missing segment files (chunks)
* implement low memory usage option
  - trade off IO versus memory use

Recovery and analysis:
* imaging: detect disk full and ask for new segment file location?
  - have libewf allow to set the segment file path during write (done)
  - like alternative segment file path in EnCase
    however EnCase seems to fully test if the segment file upfront by
    allocating the necessary disk space
* recovering corrupt EWF files (missing segment file, corrupt sections, etc.)
  - can the values in data be used to correct a corrupted volume ?

Additional (integrity) checks:
* read: check if successive headers match first header
* read: add check for next and done segment
  - really the last segment in the file
  - offset pointing at themselves
  - correct size

Possible performance improvements:
* create a offset table per segment file
  - create it on demand
  - map offset table start entry from segment table as a pointer or index number ?
* fill offset table while reading ?
  - only read first and last segment file for index build?
  - add offsets of other segment files when needed
* tune read and write buffer sizes
  - read/write block size seems to have little effect for dd on average
  - buffered bfio ?
* reduce alloc, realloc and free (this reduces breaks) use strace to analyze
  - pass values as parameters or use of handle
  - what allocation causes the break in strace of ewfacquire with compression libewf? zlib?
* optimize empty block test
* optimize string functions
  - pass length/size as much as possible

Error handling/tollerance
* what about a function that translates error into an equivalent errno?
* have wchar error messages for WINAPI?
* improve offset table correction
  - if not correctable skip chunk while reading and mark as crc error
    or try to determine offset/size of chunk somehow

Python bindings
* rewrite pyewf to match libewf API
  - library module functions
  - handle object
  - keep file object for legacy support ?
* implement error backtrace support in v2 API version
* keep certain Python function names as alias
* use Unicode strings

API changes
* add wide character functions definitions by default?
* libbfio API extension
  - add means to set pools open handle limit in libewf (partial completed)
  - add means to obtain libbfio handle of media data in ewf
  - add means to set narrow string codepage
  - export libewf_handle_get_file_io_handle, libewf_handle_open_file_io_pool
  - refactor glob functions to use libbfio handle input and return libbfio pool?
  - think about libewf_glob_file_io_handle and abstration of file io handle get/set name
* low level API
  - add function to retrieve the segment file names and amount?
  - add function to retrieve EWFX xml header/hash directly
* LVF
  - libewf_add/remove_file for LVF
* file structure API extension (idea)

device handle
* add Windows support for accessing memory device
* detect removable disk
* detect optical disk
* determine optical disk sessions
* detect floppy
* move fstat to file_io ?
* improve error detection and output (refactor error string like libbfio)
* detect bus type
* determine USB serial number

ewftools:
* add getoptlong support
* log handle
  - implement libpff log handle
* liberror
  - implement use of liberror
  - date_time.[ch] (no, wraps date time functions)
  - ewfoutput.[ch] (not necessary)
  - ewfsignal.[ch] ?
* make compilation resilient for missing crypto library
  - compile on system without libcrypto
  - remove the cryptographic options if crypto library is missing
* have failed on open return a more sensible error (extract from error)
* fix ewfcommon_signal_handler per tool
* ewfacquire
  - restrict error granularity and amount per sectors to > encase5 and > linen5 format ?
    no, although not set in EWF file, the granualarity is still used in handling read errors
  - warn if values exceed maximum segment count
  - adjust error granularity if error granularity < process buffer size
  - move ewfacquire_read_buffer to device_handle, list read errors
  - warn if media does not fit using chunk size or APIv1
    a (32-bit) chunks size of ( 64 * 512 ) will allow up to 128 TiB
* ewfacquirestream
  - what about wipe on error - does this do anything? (remove if not used)
  - add parameter to set sector size?
  - allow user to set bytes per sector for raw file conversion
* stream handle
  - implement
* ewfalter
  - allow to set maximum delta file size default 4 GiB?
* ewfexport
  - implement more ewfacquire acquiry parameters?
  - handle different input and ouput chunk sizes in low level functions build
  - allow different input and output header codepages?
* ewfdebug
  - create a tool to analyse a single segment file
  - implement low and high level api separation
* ewfrecover
  - create a tool recover ewf files

Windows build
* windows port
  - some of the Windows functions are MVC 2005 or later specific
  - figure out a way to warn about the compiler used
* add WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN or VC_EXTRALEAN to msvscpp
* locale support
  - print output convert to system string
  - reduce string conversions, use as much as possible the system string type in the tools
* ewftools check char/wchar in/output

Testing
* add export unattended to automated tests
* add encase 6.12 sha1 support to test

Deployment
* debian package
  - implement non local libuna and libbfio support like in spec file
* configure
  - remove enable-v1-api after testing?

Code clean up
* rewrite glob marcros to function macros (including arguments) ?
* rename length into size, make sure string size contains end of string character
  - length is used when the value does not contain the EOS
  - size is used when the value contains the EOS or otherwise

Known issues:
* error acquiring USB floppy with bad blocks under FreeBSD - no problem with internal floppy drive
  virtualisation could be part of the problem
* check chunk size for > 2 GiB table offsets
  the current assumption is that these chunks only can be uncompressed
  because the MSB is normally used to mark if the chunk is compressed
  This actually is a bug in EnCase 6.7.1 the behavior is gone in EnCase 6.8
* MS Visual Studio C++ does not allow pre compiler macro in macro definitions

Work in progress:
* check sprintf use
   - liberror -> liberror_error_vsnprintf
   - libewf -> libewf_hash_values, libewf_header_values
   - ewftools -> byte_size_string, guid
* what about header values parsing with preservation of timestamps?
  - change localtime to gmtime in libewf_date_time_values_copy_to_string ?
  - force set header value to require string formatted in the date format ?
* check TODO
* ewfexport: fix different input and output chunk sizes for low level functions
* fix automated tests:
  - variating buffer sizes
* test: read/write of EnCase 6.12 SHA1
* test: windows acquiry of 40 GB disk

Next stable release:
* full test
* remove/disable --enable-v1-api from configure
* remove/disable chunk size option in ewfexport
* remove/disable ewfdebug
